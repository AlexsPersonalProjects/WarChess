This is the help file for the initial PlayMenu and selecting units. Ignore this line
To start, Look at which player is currently picking a unit. 
Have that player select which unit they would like to select, and then the next player goes.
This will go until both teams are out of money.
When you are done, select the done button and the game board will pop up and you may begin unit placement.
