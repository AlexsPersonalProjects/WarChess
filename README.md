# WarChess
Personal project that I worked on a bit over the summer, not anywhere near completion. Got busy with school and so I have not been able to work on it in a long time. Once school slows down a bit I hope to be able to continue to work on it a bit more. 
The main premise of the program is a battle simulator on a chess board, with each player choosing their own lineup of pre-defined units. There are ranged, infantry, and cavalry units, each with strengths and weaknesses.
The main thing that needs to get working is the core functionality of how the game will be played. I am still not sure how I want health/damage to be done, if it is one and done like chess or if units can take a beating over multiple turns. 
As of now, iirc, it is in a pre-alpha stage where you can place units and move them, but you cannot attack or anything. See the TODO.txt in the code area for more on that.
